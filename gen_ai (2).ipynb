        "2. **Cross-reference information**: Confirm facts across multiple outlets\n",
        "3. **Identify bias**: Recognize potential biases in reporting\n",
        "4. **Contextual understanding**: Place news in historical and cultural context\n",
        "5. **Separate fact from opinion**: Distinguish between factual reporting and commentary\n",

        "## Key Analytical Frameworks\n",
        "1. **5W1H Analysis**: Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How\n",
        "2. **SWOT Analysis**: Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats\n",
        "3. **Stakeholder Analysis**: Identify who is affected and how\n",
        "4. **Trend Analysis**: How does this fit into longer-term patterns?\n",
        "5. **Comparative Analysis**: How does coverage differ across sources?\n",

        "## Best Practices for News Summarization\n",
        "1. Prioritize key information over secondary details\n",
        "2. Maintain objectivity in presentation\n",
        "3. Include diverse perspectives when available\n",
        "4. Acknowledge limitations in available information\n",
        "5. Update analysis when new information emerges\n",
        "\n",
        "## Sentiment Analysis in News\n",
        "1. **Positive sentiment**: Language expressing approval, optimism, progress\n",
        "2. **Negative sentiment**: Language expressing criticism, pessimism, decline\n",
        "3. **Neutral sentiment**: Factual reporting without evaluative language\n",
        "4. Recognize that sentiment can vary by topic, source, and audience\n",

        "## Types of News Bias\n",
        "1. **Selection bias**: What stories are covered or ignored\n",
        "2. **Placement bias**: Where stories appear and how much prominence they receive\n",
